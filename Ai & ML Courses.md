## Outstanding Machine Learning and AI Courses

Here's a carefully curated selection of exceptional, free machine learning and artificial intelligence courses featuring video lectures. All courses include high-quality lectures by some of the leading AI researchers and educators globally.

In addition to the video content, I've provided links to course websites with lecture notes, supplementary readings, and assignments.

## Introductory Courses

These courses are ideal for beginners in machine learning and AI. No prior experience is required, but a basic understanding of linear algebra, introductory calculus, and probability is beneficial. Some programming background is also recommended.
